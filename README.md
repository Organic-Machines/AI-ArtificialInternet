# AI-ArtificialInternet
AI-Guided minimalist Web Browser (Failsafe Idea Container)

A browser which provides an AI liaison:
Takes user inquiries
Requests additional specifications where applicable
    ie. quantities, dimensions, abstractions, etc.
Refactors information optimal for browser interpretation
Receives browser response
Refactors browser response into human-readable output (information, media, sources, etc.)

    Project Expansion (Suggested by ChatGPT)

    To help flesh out the idea of an AI-based internet liaison, here are possible expansions:

        Basic User Profiles: Lightweight, optional profiles that store browsing preferences, search behavior, and communication tone.

        "Question Builder" Interface: Before sending a search or command, users are shown blanks ("What exactly are you seeking? Where should it search first?") to complete or ignore.

        Result Shaping: After a result is retrieved, users can quickly "tune" results ("More technical," "More casual," "More visual," etc.) without restarting the search.

        Conversation Memory Mode: When enabled, the browser can "remember" specific conversations tied to particular browsing sessions (e.g., project-specific research).

        Blind Spot Detection: The AI proactively identifies unclear instructions or missing search terms and prompts the user before committing a request.

        Customizable Personal Vocabulary: Users can add their own slang, shorthand, or preferred terms, so the AI interprets queries in a personalized way.

        Real-Time Co-Pilot Summary: A sidebar or pop-up that continuously summarizes what the user is doing/searching for, like a live mission log.

        Collaborative Mode: Multiple users can browse together in a shared session, with AI mediating and assisting conversations and goal alignment.
